          <h1>Guide to Fighting (And Winning) Your Traffic Tickets</h1>
          <p>Here you will find the best tips and tricks to fight your traffic tickets and win!</p>
          <p>First, you need to know what you're up against. The traffic court system is a complex and confusing system. It is designed to be that way. The more confusing it is, the more likely you are to give up and pay the ticket. Don't let that happen to you!</p> 
          <p>Here are some stats that might help convince you to fight your ticket, regarding ward 20:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Over a time, 7.8943 percent of traffic tickets have been dismissed</li>
            <li>For those who have contested the ticket in court, 63.7034 percent have been deemed not liable, and did not have to pay the fine.</li>
            <li>Out of the 9 percent of people who contested their expired plates ticket, 69.6531 percent were able to successfully contest their ticket</li>
            <li>Out of the 6 percent of people who contested their residential parking permit tickets, 41.5384 percent were able to dismiss the fine.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>A Step by Step Guide</h2>
          <ol>
              <li>First of all, act quickly. You have 7 days from the issues of a parking/compliance violation to contest the ticket. If you do not contest your ticket within that time, you have another 21 days to request a hearing. If no response is received in those 21 days, a Notice of Determination is issued. You have another 21 days to contest the ticket, after-which, you forfeit your right to challenge.</li>
              <li>Some tickets will automatically receive a hearing date and time, which will be printed on your ticket. If it does not, follow the instructions on your ticket to request one</li>
              <li>Get your evidence together. For each violation there are many factors which can lead to a dismissal of your traffic ticket, like an inoperable meter for a parking ticket, or inconsistent facts for a speeding violation<a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/fin/supp_info/revenue/challenging_tickets/contesting_in_person.html">(Here is a list of allowed defenses).</a> Err on the side of too much evidence rather than too little. A photo that shows only part of the block probably will not convince the judge that there are no signs on the entire block. Witnesses are also a good resource to bring</li>
              <li>On the day of the hearing, ensure a few things:
                  <ul>
                  <li>Wear formal/nice clothing. This lends you more credibility and trustworthiness</li>
                  <li>Arrive early. This will give you time to get your bearings and prepare for the hearing</li>
                  <li>Bring your evidence. This is the most important thing. If you do not have your evidence, you will not be able to prove your case</li>
                  <li>Bring a witness if you have one. This will help strengthen your case</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li>The city will present its side of the case first, brining evidence gathered against you. In many cases, the hearing officer dismisses the violation at this point, if they believe there is not enough evidence.</li>
              <li>If needed, present your evidence and tell the hearing officer your side of the story. Ensure to follow court etiquette closely at this point, making sure not to talk over the officer, answering questions honestly and respectfully.</li>
              <li>If you lose your hearing, you have 35 days to appeal to the circuit court, during which you can only present the evidence you have used during this trial.</li>
          </ol>
